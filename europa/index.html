	<em>
	  The gameplay in Europa is different than regular Dungeons and Dragons in several ways:<br><br>
	  Instead of standard HP, players have a spacesuit O<sub>2</sub> level (percentage) and a suit integrity level (max 30). O<sub>2</sub> depletes gradually over time until the player returns to their ship. If a player depletes all of their O<sub>2</sub>, they die of asphyxiation. If a player's suit integrity drops to zero, they die of the near-absolute-zero temperatures of space flooding their suit.<br><br>
	  The action and combat systems are slightly more rigid. To perform a basic action, players must first agree with fellow players (if there is any diasgreement between players, resolve with a highest-roll-take-all D20 roll). Armor and weapons are "locked" by AXOL Command on the ship until players achieve a specified goal or milestone, which will reward them points used to buy newly unlocked things.
