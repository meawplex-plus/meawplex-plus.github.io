  <h1>Contributing to lispmath</h1>
  <p><strong>When I say "contribute", what do you think I mean?</strong></p>
  <p>I don't mean:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Changing important files for no reason (i.e. the <strong>.gitignore</strong>)</li>
    <li>Saying ruid/unnecessary things about others' work; "This will <em>never</em> work!!" is an example of this, also "Don't put that there!" in no context is an example.</li>
    <li>Being violent about who does what work and who will do what when, etc. People have their own schedules!!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I do mean:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Helping people doing hard work to modify files / create new ones</li>
    <li>Making new files / modding them yourself!!</li>
    <li>Finding issues and fixing them, where you can.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are our rules and guidelines.</p>
  <ol type='I'>
    <li>Do not mod the <strong>.gitignore</strong> unless your computer is giving files in pushes that are not supposed to be in there; if it is, notify us and tell us what is being included wrongly.</li>
    <li>Respect others. If someone is modding a file, as mentioned earlier here, don't say hurtful things to them!</li>
    <li>When you create a file, make sure everyone knows why in your pull request.</li>
    <li>Don't use pull requests constantly. Put large groups of files in one large pull, not 30 separate ones.</li>
    <li>No strong language. None of it. If it is used, you will possibly be blocked from the contrib.</li>
    <li>Have fun!! And... stay a Lisper!</li>
  </ol>
